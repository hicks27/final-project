	<h3>Career</h3>
	<p>I have been a groomer for over 15 year's and enjoying what i do everyday. 
	I have had a love for dog's for as long asd I can remember. After 10 years I 
	decided to add on a doggy day care. It helps owners feel at ease that their 
	four legget babbies are not stuck in the house all day.</p>
